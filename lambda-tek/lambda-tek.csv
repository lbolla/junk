"Software","Netgear STM150 ProSecure Web and Email Threat Management Appliance with Software Maintenance and Upgrades Netgear STM150 ProSecure Web and Email Threat Management Appliance STM150 Bundle (Hardware including 1-year Web, 1-year Email, and 1-year Software Maintenance & Upgrades, 24/7 Support, and Advanced Replacement)  The NETGEAR STM combines best-of-breed security features and patent-pending Stream Scanning Technology, providing SMBs with comprehensive, effective, yet simple, and affordable Web and email protection against ever growing Internet-based threats. Malware, spyware, worms, spam, and phishing attacks, are all propagated through Web and email protocols and are becoming more creative and sophisticated, making use of multiple components to attack clients under increasingly stealthy guises. Today's Web and email threats blend multiple malware and multiple attack vectors to achieve criminal intent. Such attacks are used en masse to disable or steal computing resources and information. Moreover, such attacks accomplish these aims piggybacking on not only email traffic, but also increasingly through real-time Web traffic &#8364;&#8220; a historically difficult application to protect because of its low-latency requirements. Enterprise-class Security Information security threats pose serious dangers to both enterprises and SMBs alike &#8364;&#8220; consequently, SMBs require the same level of security protection that enterprises enjoy. However, security products aimed at the SMB often either employ watered down commercial anti-malware engines or use open source engines. These engines contain a limited signature database, weak detection algorithms, have slow response times to new threats, and are not optimized for real-time Web traffic. Enterprise-class technologies differ from cheaper alternate solutions by protecting the entire spectrum of a particular threat vector as opposed to covering only a small subset of it. However, these technologies are often times processor intensive and require expensive hardware to run effectively. At the core of the STM is NETGEAR patent-pending Web-optimized Stream Scanning architecture. NETGEAR STM Stream Scanning Technology allows the use of enterprise-class technologies while maintaining high throughput. NETGEAR has partnered with industry-leading Kaspersky Lab and Commtouch to bring best-of-breed Web and email scanning technology engines to the STM platform. Running on top of the Stream Scanning platform, these engines work in parallel with the NETGEAR heuristics engine to protect against known and unknown threats. The NETGEAR STM is built upon many enterprise-class technologies: Enterprise-class Anti-malware Engine - The STM features a full enterprise grade antimalware engine with advanced scanning algorithms and a signature library of over hundreds of thousands of malware signatures. Compared to many competing products that often use a very limited signature set for performance reasons (thousands versus hundreds of thousands of signatures), the difference in coverage is over a hundred fold. Viruses, spyware, and other malware are detected and blocked. Spyware phone homes and drive-by downloads are also stopped by the STM, preventing further infection and protecting your valuable information. Zero Hour Threat Protection - For zero hour threats, the STM's ""in the cloud"" infrastructure identifies new threats at zero hour, proactively stopping new malware, phishing attacks, spam, bad URLs, and zombie/bot attacks before they reach end user environments. It probes over two billion transactions daily from data sources such as zero hour malware patterns, phishing detection, threat research, IP reputation, spam messages, and zombie data. Industry-leading Anti-spam Engine - The NETGEAR anti-spam engine features a Distributed Spam Analysis architecture that uses an ""in the cloud"" approach to feed global up-to-the-minute spam outbreak information to the appliance to stop new spam. The result is the highest spam detection and lowest false positive rates in the industry*. Unlike open source and other traditional anti-spam filters, Distributed Spam Analysis has superior adaptability to new types of spam, performs equally well with spam of all languages, and has no ""learning"" period. New spam is classified and detected within minutes of emerging onto the Internet. Enterprise-class URL Filter - The STM's URL filtering engine employs enterprise-class Web filter technology with URLs divided into 64 categories for specific and targeted administration. With a database of over 100 million URLs, the NETGEAR STM URL filtering engine relies on HTTP connectors deployed ""in the cloud"" at service providers throughout the world to classify and update URL entries in real time. The NETGEAR STM URL filtering engine automatically selfadapts and categorizes new URLs that have previously been unknown &#8364;&#8220; unlike less effective approaches that force administrators to manually ""submit"" new entries one by one. The URL filter not only blocks access to unwanted sites, but also blocks sites containing spyware. IM, P2P, Toolbar Application Control** &#8364;&#8220; Enforce company network usage policies with the STM's application control feature. Preserve productivity by blocking access to public IM clients such as AIM, Yahoo! Messenger, ICQ, and MSN Messenger and save bandwidth by blocking streaming audio and video applications like RealPlayer, iTunes, and Winamp. Stop annoying toolbars from downloading and running on client Web browsers. With the STM, NETGEAR brings security to the SMB that was previously reserved for the enterprise. Revolutionary Stream Scanning Platform Typically, best-of-breed security software technologies are very processor and memory intensive. Given the high performance requirements of scanning latency sensitive Web traffic, incorporating enterprise grade security software technologies onto SMB-priced hardware platforms has traditionally been a very difficult task. The NETGEAR STM features patent-pending Stream Scanning Technology which analyses data streams as they enter the network. The NETGEAR Stream Scanning approach is many times faster than that of more traditional batch-based scanning methods where the entire file is buffered before it is scanned. Because of its nature, traditional batch-based scanning methods introduce latency to network traffic. While latency is more tolerable for email traffic, for large amounts of HTTP Web traffic, such latency often slows Web browsing to a crawl. Traditional approaches to work around this problem include the use of proxies, scanning only a handful of file types, or clustering multiple units. However, these strategies are typically difficult to configure and install, very expensive, often less secure, and still do not provide the same level of performance made possible by NETGEAR patent-pending Stream Scanning Technology. This Stream Scanning architecture is the foundation on which the STM is built. Simple Setup, Ease of Management The STM deploys in-line in a matter of minutes, anywhere in the network. It runs automatically and unobtrusively. There is no need to reconfigure the network, unlike traditional proxy-based solutions. Simply set and forget. Administration is performed through an intuitive Web-based interface. Set granular policies and alerts, check summary statistics and graphical reports, drill down to IP address-level data, and integrate log data with standard network management tools such as SNMP. For many administrators and IT personnel one of their biggest nightmares is the management of individual licenses or ""seats"". Buying additional licenses when computers and personnel are added to the network is time-consuming and costly. The NETGEAR STM series offers Web and email protection subscriptions with no ""per-user"" licensing. "

Unless you happen to be looking at one of Samsung's new plasma TVs. Every frame is seamlessly smooth because we put 10 full subfields into each frame. That's 600Hz. So contours are crisper, scrolling text sharper and the juddering issue is finally put to rest. 3 HDMI All it takes is one cable to connect your TV to your other audio and video sources. Our HDMI slot allows you to import all kinds of content without compression including pictures and videos from your digital camcorders and multimedia PCs. Now enjoying it all on a wide HD screen couldn't be easier. Mega Dynamic Contrast (PDP) Getting a true cinematic experience used to mean going to the cinema. But with Mega Dynamic Contrast Ratio true cinematic clarity comes to plasmas. Every frame is saturated with dense, rich colour. Blacks have more depth and the whites are unbelievably pristine. The only thing missing is a large head blocking your view. Every angle is right with Clear Image Panel. Amazing picture quality can&#8364;&#8482;t exist with blurring on your screen. That&#8364;&#8482;s why we developed Clear Image Panel for our new plasma TVs. It uses a film filter instead of conventional glass to eliminate layered images and produce ones that are ultra-clear and blur-free from almost every angle. Wide Colour Enhancer Capturing nature is the goal of an artist. We've achieved it as well with our Wide Colour Enhancer. Our unique 3D colour stretching technology saturates each pixel until it achieves the true colour and luminescence intended by nature. So every colour on the RGB spectrum is brought to life. It is a work of art. Response Time 0.0001ms It's hard to beat the speed of light. That's how fast our plasma screens respond to each new image. 0.001ms is all it takes for each pixel to re-generate clear, crisp, robust colours. That's why there's no blur or ghosting in the picture. And there's less strain on your eyes. You can't beat that. "

Additionally, the camera incorporates an infrared (IR) cut filter that, when used with a separate IR lamp, allows for video capture in total darkness. The Cisco WVC2300 camera supports dual codecs (MPEG-4 and MJPEG). Both codecs can be used simultaneously. MPEG-4 gives efficient bandwidth consumption with good-quality compression and is optimal for real-time viewing of video. MJPEG gives optimal video quality with lossy compression, making it ideal for large-volume storage to a network attached storage (NAS) device. The Cisco WVC2300's audio capabilities include two-way audio, embedded microphone, external speaker and microphone ports, and voice compression. With extensive feature support, such as IP multicast, Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), Real Time Protocol (RTP), and 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), it enables video to be viewed from multiple endpoints and client applications such as 3G phones, and QuickTime clients on PCs or Wi-Fi phones. The wireless capabilities of the WVC2300 include support for 1x2 multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO), providing better range than traditional 802.11g, and strong wireless security utilizing Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). Support for multiple network protocols like 802.1p priority, 802.1Q VLANs, and Dynamic DNS (DDNS), make the solution ideal for multiple IP surveillance applications. The cameras can also be managed securely using HTTPS. "

"Components & Storage","Antec TPQ-1200 GB POWER QUATTRO 1200W - CONTINUOUS POWER UK Antec TPQ-1200 GB TruePower Quattro 1200 Power Supply, GB  HIGH-PERFORMANCE POWER SUPPLY The TPQ-1200 goes beyond the kilowatt range of standard power supply units (PSUs) to power the largest servers and video workstations. It includes six rails of +12V output to deliver safe and reliable power to your system, and enough power and cables available to run three or more separate high-end graphics cards simultaneously. STANDARDS AND FEATURES The TruePower Quattro series is compatible with ATX12V v2.3 and EPS12V v2.91 specifications. The TPQ-1200 PSU features Universal Input, which automatically senses when you connect the power supply to any AC power source between 100~240V without having to worry about setting a voltage switch, and Active Power Factor Correction (Active PFC), which improves the power factor value of the power supply by altering the input current wave shape, thus helping transmission across the power grid. CONTINUOUS POWER OUTPUT RATING Unlike other power supplies that are rated by their peak wattage, Antec power supplies are rated based on their continuous power output. This means that your TPQ-1200 delivers 1200-watt power during normal, continuous operation; not simply at its peak. SYSTEM PROTECTION The TPQ-1200 also includes a variety of industrial-grade protective circuitry: OCP (Over Current Protection), OVP (Over Voltage Protection), UVP (Under Voltage Protection), and SCP (Short Circuit Protection). Sometimes the PSU will &#8364;&#339;latch&#8364;? into a protected state. This means that you will need to clear the fault and turn the power off to the SU before it will function again. There are no user-replaceable fuses in your TPQ-1200. 80 PLUS SILVER CERTIFICATION 80 PLUS certification is the most widely recognized independent standard in power supply efficiency. An 80 PLUS certified power supply uses less energy and generates less heat to stay cooler, run quieter and last longer. The TPQ-1200 earns the rare 80 PLUS Silver level of efficiency, meaning that it has been certified to be at least 85% efficient at a wide range of operating loads; this will lower your operating costs and help protect the environment. NVIDIA&#8222; SLI&#8222;-READY CERTIFICATION Antec&#8364;&#8482;s TruePower Quattro power supplies are NVIDIA&#8222; SLI&#8222;-Ready certified for use with multiple high-end graphics cards for superior parallel graphics processing. ADVANCED HYBRID CABLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM The TPQ-1200 uses Advanced Hybrid Cable Management. Cables that are important or mandatory are connected directly to the PSU. There are also modular connectors on the back of the PSU to add additional cables as needed. Using only the power cables you need will reduce clutter and improve airflow inside your case. DC TO DC CONVERSION The TPQ-1200 uses DC to DC conversion for the +5V and +3.3V rails. This module operates at 85% efficiency, as opposed to traditional magnetic amplifiers that operate at only 75% efficiency. Transient response time is almost 100 times faster, providing remarkably stable power output in response to changing loads. PULSE WIDTH MODULATION (PWM) FAN Pulse Width Modulation technology allows the TPQ-1200 to finely control the speed of the PSU&#8364;&#8482;s fan. By using this method instead of the traditional voltage-controlled fans, this PSU&#8364;&#8482;s fan can run up to 50% quieter than standard fans. A PWM fan can run as slow as 10-15% of the fan&#8364;&#8482;s rated top speed, whereas a voltage regulated fan can only go as low as 40%. +12 VOLT RAIL DISTRIBUTION The TPQ-1200 uses six separate +12 volt power rails. The engineers have allocated the rails to different connectors to prevent voltage sags in one device due to sudden demands for power by another device. "

With remote monitoring in high resolution at a fraction of the cost, this improves dramatically on conventional CCTV surveillance systems. Instant Live View D-Link&#8364;&#8482;s intuitive GUI interface simplifies viewing live and recorded video from the NVR. Each camera can be set up with their own compression, resolution and frame rate on a single page. Total available recording time for the system is also clearly displayed. A variety of options are available for viewing and organising camera footage on-screen. For a system with multiple channels, users can switch cameras by simple drag and drop. A single camera may be viewed full-screen with optional two-way audio. Cameras equipped with pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) functions can be controlled using the interface buttons or by directly clicking on the video. A given camera position can be saved and later restored in a click. Extensive Recording Functionality The NVR records video from up to 4 local and remote IP cameras. Each camera can be independently set to record continuously or during specific timeframes. Specific events such as motion can also be set to trigger recording. When HDD space runs out, the NVR can be configured to overwrite the oldest data automatically, allowing for continuous and uninterrupted recording. Users can specify the number of days the recording should be kept (within the limits of the HDD capacity). For example, if the NVR has the capacity to store 7 days of recording, using the overwrite option, the NVR will record the 8th day and delete the 1st day. The NVR also provides the option to stop recording when the HDD is full. Should the disk reach capacity, a notification can be sent via e-mail or to an external device such as an audible alarm or LED display via the DI/DO interface. Powerful Event Management The NVR centrally controls digital output, e-mail notifications and recording for all the connected cameras: for example, if camera 1 detects motion, the NVR can trigger camera 2 to record, camera 3 to output a light and camera 4 to adjust to a preset position. These events will be logged, with optional notifications via e-mail or output devices. Users can set up multiple contact lists for event notification. A straightforward logging system organises events by date for easy recall. Intelligent Playback After selecting a desired video period for display, the NVR can instantly begin playback. The DNS-726-4 supports 4 channel simultaneous playback, with up to 16x fast forward or fast backward speed. The step playback option displays one frame at a time. Additionally, users can enhance the recorded video with controls such as brightness, contrast, and sharpness. Two formats are available to export video: the AVI format will export raw video and the ASF file format will transpose a timestamp on the exported video. If a printer is connected to the user&#8364;&#8482;s PC, the NVR can also print the selected still image. Smart Search With the Smart Search function, detecting notable events becomes effortless. By selecting a target area on the video and setting search sensitivity, the Smart Search will go through the video database and locate noteworthy events. Search criteria include motion detection, missing object, lost focus or camera occlusion. Comprehensive data and hardware security The NVR ensures the security and integrity of IP camera footage at every stage: - Administrators can filter external connections to the NVR by IP address to limit access, and choose access privileges for users by specifying the cameras they may access for live view, playback, audio and PTZ functions. - Recorded data is stored in a secure database. This recorded data can be backed up to additional storage locations periodically or whenever needed. The NVR also includes the option to protect data using a RAID 1 configuration. RAID 1 duplicates the recordings database onto two separate drives. In the event of an HDD failure, data integrity is maintained on the secondary HDD. - A UPS can be used as emergency power supply for the NVR. The UPS uses a USB interface to notify the NVR to perform a proper shutdown before battery power runs out. In the event of a power failure without a UPS, the NVR will boot up automatically once power is restored. Of course, the security of data is irrelevant unless the device itself is protected from theft. For this reason, the sleek NVR enclosure is compact and easy to conceal in a secure remote location. A front panel lock protects the HDD and a rear panel lock can be used to secure the NVR with a cable. Complete Network Functionality The D-Link NVR can connect directly to the Internet without requiring a router. Dynamic DNS is supported for systems operating without a fixed IP address. The NVR can then be reached from the Internet using a domain name that is easy to remember. To ensure the accuracy of time, essential if the video footage is to be used as evidence, the NVR can update the system clock from an Internet server using the Network Time Protocol (NTP). D-ViewCam NVR Software The D-ViewCam NVR software is bundled with the D-Link NVR. It consists of: - the &#8364;&#339;Playback Manager&#8364;?, a clean and simple web GUI interface that allows users to play, search or export video - the &#8364;&#339; Backup and File Manager&#8364;?, a flexible backup utility that simplifies the process of backing up video data from the NVR to external storage. - the &#8364;&#339;Multi-NVR Viewer&#8364;? which supports simultaneous display of up to 16 channels. You can easily organise the view by directly dragging and dropping video onto the display window. Cameras managed by the NVR can also be viewed as individual sites or categorised into groups. "

"Software","Netgear STM300 ProSecure Bundle - STM300 Appliance + 1 Year Email, Web and Maintenance licenses Netgear STM300 ProSecure Web and Email Threat Management Appliance STM300 Bundle (Hardware including 1-year Web, 1-year Email, and 1-year Software Maintenance & Upgrades, 24/7 Support, and Advanced Replacement)  Enterprise-strength Spam, Virus, and Web Filter Security The ProSecure STM series of Web and email security appliances combine best-of-breed security technologies and patented* Stream Scanning Technology to protect businesses against today&#8364;&#8482;s Web and email threats. Viruses and spyware hosted on Web pages, email phishing attacks, spam, malware infected emails, and other threats are now all part of a regular repertoire of sophisticated blended attacks that businesses now face. While other solutions significantly dilute the efficacy of their offering by either utilizing open source or cutting essential features and services from their enterprise products to cut costs, ProSecure has partnered with industry-leading Kaspersky Lab and Commtouch to bring best-of-breed enterprise-strength Web and email security technologies to the STM platform. Web and Email Security - Redefined ProSecure STM Appliances combine performance with comprehensive security coverage. Patented Stream Scanning Technology enables the use of an extensive virus and malware database while maintaining a high level of throughput and minimizing scanning-induced latency. The flexible modular software design architecture leverages patented Stream Scanning Technology to scan files and data streams up to 5x faster than conventional methods. The ProSecure STM employs millions of signatures to protect against known malware threats, and advanced behavioral zero-hour protection technology to proactively discover and block any suspected threats that have not yet been identified. The ProSecure STM utilizes a hybrid in-the-cloud Distributed Spam/Web Analysis architecture that shields networks from spam, phishing attacks, malicious Web sites, unwanted content, and other Web and email-borne threats. The STM&#8364;&#8482;s application control feature allows businesses to enforce company network usage policies and preserve productivity by blocking access to public instant messaging and peer-to-peer applications. With ProSecure STM, subscriptions are simple with no per-user licensing. ProSecure Web and Email subscriptions each contain comprehensive protection for an unlimited number of users. Revolutionary Stream Scanning Platform Given the high performance requirements of scanning latency sensitive Web traffic, incorporating enterprise-grade security software technologies into traditional content security platforms has been a very difficult task. That is why the ProSecure STM features patented Stream Scanning Technology which analyzes data streams as they enter the network. The ProSecure Stream Scanning approach is many times faster than that of traditional batch-based scanning methods in which the entire file is buffered before it is scanned. Because of its nature, traditional batch-based scanning methods introduce latency to network traffic. While latency is more tolerable for email traffic, for large amounts of HTTP Web traffic, such latency often slows Web browsing to a crawl. Content security solutions in the past have tried to overcome the latency issue by minimizing the malware signature set, scanning only a handful of file types, or by avoiding Web traffic scanning altogether. This approach exposes an entire vector of the network to malware-based attacks. Simple Setup, Ease of Management The ProSecure STM deploys in-line in a matter of minutes, anywhere in the network. It runs automatically and unobtrusively. There is no need to reconfigure the network, unlike traditional proxy-based solutions. Simply set and forget. Administration is performed through an intuitive Web-based interface. Set granular per user/group-based policies and alerts, check summary statistics and graphical reports, drill down to IP address-level data, send log data to third party syslog servers, and integrate with standard network management tools via SNMP. For many administrators and IT personnel one of their biggest nightmares is the management of individual licenses or &#8364;&#339;seats&#8364;?. Buying additional licenses when computers and personnel are added to the network is time consuming and costly. The ProSecure STM series offers Web and email protection subscriptions with no &#8364;&#339;per-user&#8364;? licensing. "

Those who have already converted to a headset surely appreciate the relief on their spine from no longer having to wedge their phone between shoulder and neck. You unquestionably enjoy the convenience of having your hands free to grab files or type into the computer. You have made the headset even more useful by going wireless, combining your regular wired headset with a DW 800 wireless system. This allows you to roam around the office to grab a fax, a print out or even a coffee, without interrupting an important phone conversation. So what about when the phone rings while you are away from your desk? Maybe you can't even hear it and miss the call entirely. If you are within hearing range but don't have an electronic call taker built into your phone, you will have to rush back to your desk and be embarrassingly short of breath. And if the conversation ends while you are roaming around, the seemingly endless beeping of the disconnected line is enough to drive you crazy until you can get back to your phone to hang up. But do not despair. With a clever little device, Sennheiser Communications now offers the solution. The mechanical handset lifter, HSL 10, lets you automatically pick up or hang up the telephone handset, even if you are not at your desk. The HSL 10 is connected to a compatible base station, which is in touch with your wireless headset or system. By answering or ending the call on your wireless system, you send a command to the HSL 10 to raise or lower the telephone handset. Of course, it works within the entire range of your system's base station. What's more, the handset lifter can be trained to recognize the sound of your phone ringing, so that even if you are not close enough to hear it, the HSL 10 will. The intelligent gadget then passes the ring signal to your wireless system to inform you of the incoming call. Now that's convenient. "

Outlook Web Access can be used on other client platforms through browsers. - Exchange Server 2003 with SP1 and later includes connectors for Novell GroupWise 5.x and IBM Lotus Notes R5 and R6.

Companies do not need separate deployments for mobile features nor do they need to purchase or maintain separate mobile servers. Mobile features are now enabled on all back-end and front-end Exchange servers. When wireless access is lost there is no need to despair. Outlook 2003 is designed to work over slow and poor network connections: Mobile workers are shielded from network issues and can continue working with their Exchange Server information while Exchange Server and Outlook use the available network resources. Windows Mobile&#8364;&#8220;based devices, such as Windows Mobile&#8364;&#8220;based Pocket PCs, come with the Exchange ActiveSync client and Microsoft Office Outlook Mobile built in, which enables you to sync your e-mail messages, calendar, and contacts lists directly with Exchange Server 2003. Exchange Server administrators can enable this from the same screen used to manage Exchange Server e-mail accounts. Similar to Outlook Web Access for desktop browsers, Outlook Mobile Access is designed for security-enhanced access from mobile device browsers. With Exchange Server 2003, users can gain access to their mailboxes from mobile devices with HTML, XHTML (WAP 2.x), and CHTML-based microbrowsers. - Remote workers can work at home, a satellite office, a customer site, an 802.11 hot spot such as their local Internet caf, and can use Outlook Web Access from any Internet-connected computer to gain security-enhanced access to Exchange Server. Outlook Web Access in Exchange Server 2003 has been improved for easier use, speed, and greater security. The latest features in Exchange Server 2003 have been extended to any browser-based computer, including non-Microsoft operating systems, including: - Spelling checker - Task list support - HTML and attachment blocking to help prevent spam and potential beacon-finding code - Automatic logoff. The inactivity time-out automatically logs off and closes out your session. With the new UI, most users have to look twice to see if they are using Outlook 2003 or Outlook Web Access. You also get support for S/MIME in Outlook Web Access so that you can digitally sign and encrypt your e-mail messages. Working remotely but still want the use of the full Outlook client? In previous versions of Exchange Server, using the full Outlook client connecting over the Internet required a virtual private network (VPN) connection. Now, Outlook 2003 users can easily connect over the Internet to their Exchange servers using HTTP or HTTPS without the need for a VPN connection. This translates to another saving for the IT department. - Traveling workers can run Outlook 2003 from their hotel or between flight connections over a dial-up line and synchronize their e-mail messages. With the latest synchronized Exchange Server data, they can continue working offline until their next opportunity to dial in and reconnect. Outlook 2003 and Exchange Server 2003 help them to be productive online and offline. - All workers can take advantage of Windows Mobile&#8364;&#8220;based devices to stay on top of things while away from their computers. Pocket PC, Pocket PC Phone Edition, and Windows Mobile&#8364;&#8220;based Smartphones enable you to synchronize your wireless device directly to the Exchange server by using Exchange ActiveSync technology. E-mail messages, contacts, schedules, and attachments are at your fingertips. Cost Savings with Exchange Server 2003 The Exchange Server 2003 upgrade and administration tools increase your worker productivity and help consolidate your servers to save you money. Consolidation Scenario For organizations running Exchange Server 5.5, upgrading presents a great opportunity to lower TCO by: - Simplifying operations - Increasing server availability and reliability - Reducing the time it takes to do backup and restores - Reducing the number of servers running Exchange Server Exchange Server 2003 improves upon Exchange 2000 Server with a multiple database design (up to 20 databases per server). Typical Exchange Server 5.5 organizations have 1,000&#8364;&#8220;2,000 users per server, limited primarily because of a single database architecture and the time required for backup and restore operations and management. With Exchange Server 2003, however, the number of supported users and mailboxes can easily be in the 3,000&#8364;&#8220;5,000 range or more, depending upon the user profiles, message traffic patterns, and mailbox size limitations. Administrative Productivity Exchange Server 2003 is designed to help your messaging IT staff to be more productive. Ongoing administration of an Exchange Server environment represents about 20&#8364;&#8220;25 percent of TCO for Exchange Server. The new and enhanced tools help your IT staff to do their job more efficiently. For example, an executive might need to recover an old, but very important, e-mail message that was deleted a few months ago. By using the new Recovery Storage Group, an administrator can recover an individual user's mailbox to find the important e-mail message that was previously deleted. Other new administrative features include: - Move multiple mailboxes in parallel. - Improved message tracking and Outlook client performance logging. - Enhanced queue viewer that enables both SMTP and X.400 queues to be seen from the same console. - New query-based distribution lists that now support dynamic, real-time lookups for members.

Exchange Server 2007 acts as the first scan on incoming e-mail, determines the legitimacy of the e-mail message, and if applicable, disables links or URLs present in the e-mail to help protect users. - Control distribution of sensitive work. Help protect your company assets by preventing recipients from forwarding, copying, or printing important e-mail messages by using information rights management (IRM) functionality. You can even specify an expiration date for the message, after which it cannot be viewed or otherwise acted upon. IRM functionality requires Microsoft Windows Server 2003 or later running Microsoft Windows Rights Management Services (RMS). - Maintain compliance with managed e-mail folders. Exchange Server 2007 offers managed e-mail folders, a new approach to document retention, archiving, and regulatory compliance. Users see and interact with these folders in Office Outlook 2007 just like any other mail folder, but the messages stored within this folder gain retention, archive, and expiration policies defined by the administrator. With managed e-mail folders, users and administrators can easily comply with various forms of external regulation and internal company policies regarding message retention. - Help ensure e-mail legitimacy with Office Outlook 2007 E-mail Postmark. Office Outlook 2007 E-mail Postmark helps ensure that e-mail reaching your inbox is legitimate and that e-mail sent by Outlook 2007 will be trusted by the recipient&#8364;&#8482;s client. Creating mail with Office Outlook 2007 E-mail Postmark uses new technology that Microsoft has developed as part of the ongoing effort to curb junk mail. This technology asks the sender&#8364;&#8482;s computer to perform a computation or puzzle, and then assigns this work as a token of legitimacy to the e-mail message. These e-mail postmarks are designed to make it very time-consuming and technologically detrimental for users to send mass e-mail like spam, yet they do not change the user experience of sending e-mail.

"Software","MICROSOFT SHAREPOINT WORKSPACE 2010 32-BIT/X64 ENGLISH DVD Microsoft SharePoint Workspace 2010, EN SharePoint Workspace 2010, EN, DVD  Microsoft SharePoint Workspace 2010, the new name for Microsoft Office Groove, expands the boundaries of collaboration by allowing fast, anytime, anywhere access to your Microsoft SharePoint team sites. Synchronize SharePoint Server 2010 document libraries with SharePoint Workspace so you can access, view, and edit files anytime and anywhere from your computer. Lists such as Discussion, Tasks, and custom lists are supported as well. You can even synchronize Business Connectivity Services lists so access to your backend systems is even easier. SharePoint Workspace 2010 ushers in an entirely new way of working with your SharePoint team sites. Sync with SharePoint sites - With just a few clicks, you can synchronize SharePoint libraries and lists to your computer. - Access synchronized SharePoint libraries and lists locally on your PC, even when disconnected from your SharePoint server. - Edit content when not connected to SharePoint server and your changes are cached &#8364;&#8221; waiting for synchronization. - Be confident that your changes will automatically synchronize to the server when you&#8364;&#8482;re back on line and connected. - Save time when uploading and downloading content because SharePoint Workspace only syncs your changes, not the full document. - Stay in the know. When files get changed on your SharePoint site, you can see the latest in SharePoint Workspace. Add content with Direct Folder Access - Access your SharePoint document libraries as though they were local Windows folders. - Work with your files from a SharePoint site, browse them in your local folders, or even save files from other applications into those same folders. - Be confident that added files will sync back to your SharePoint site.1 Search all available workspaces - Easily search through your local copies of content using a powerful integration of Windows Search. - You can customize your search queries to pinpoint your results exactly. - Search from the Launchbar, the workspace, or directly from the Windows Start button. Work together more successfully - When you are connected to SharePoint Server 2010, you can: - Use Check Out / Check In control to limit access to content you are working on. - Review the title, tags, and keywords added to your content (using SharePoint properties) that make your content easier to search for and find. - See version history and even revert to earlier versions, if necessary. - Co-author in Word 2010 and PowerPoint 2010. - In addition to SharePoint workspaces, you can use Groove workspaces to collaborate with advanced security directly between team members without SharePoint Server. Groove workspaces are the collaborative ""peer"" workspaces familiar to users of Microsoft Office Groove. - As before, Groove workspaces can have one or more members, and offer a variety of productivity tools, such as Discussion, Calendar, and Documents. You can choose between two versions of Groove workspaces: 2010 (which is the default), and 2007 (for compatibility with Microsoft Office Groove 2007). Each Groove workspace version lets you add a different collection of tools. It&#8364;&#8482;s important to note that the workspace versions are mutually exclusive and that the following restrictions apply: All members of a 2010 workspace must be running Microsoft SharePoint Workspace 2010. All members of a 2007 workspace must be running Microsoft Office Groove 2007 or Microsoft SharePoint Workspace 2010. Get easier access to the right tools at the right time New and improved features can help you be more productive, but only if you can find them when you need them. The Ribbon replaces traditional menus and toolbars with a fresh, highly visual layout of commands, grouped logically in tabs, to help you find the features you need fast. The new Ribbon is also customizable to meet your personal work style. Use the Ribbon to check out or check in content or to quickly check the version of a file. Use the new Microsoft Office Backstage&#8222; view to view your Launchbar or search for content. You can now more easily customize your SharePoint Workspace 2010 experience, all from one convenient location. Access your information from more places with Office Mobile 2010 SharePoint Workspace Mobile 2010, available as part of Office Mobile 2010, gives you the power to get things done on your Windows phone: - View Document libraries and lists: Quickly connect to your SharePoint server and access content from anywhere. - Access documents via your phone: Open documents using Office Mobile directly from SharePoint; edit them and save back to the server easily. - Access offline and sync changes: You can sync a document to your phone to access it later. When you do, any changes get saved back to SharePoint automatically. - Stay up to date: Keep a document synced locally so that when team members change it, you&#8364;&#8482;ll always be up to date.2 - Stay in sync: You can see all of your content, calendar, and contacts while mobile.

The latest top of the range graphics cards from both ATI and Nvidia are demanding more power than ever before and the latest flagship motherboards are equally demanding once you start pushing the limits of your system by overclocking it. The new Silent Pro Gold series from Cooler Master addresses all of these problems while maintaining &#8364;&#8220; or even exceeding &#8364;&#8220; an extraordinary 90 percent power efficiency under load at 220V, which gains it an 80 Plus Gold certification. Innovative and Patented Technologies The Silent Pro Gold series features an entirely new design with several innovative and patented technologies. Cooler Master has created HTT&#8222; (Heat Transfer Technology), a unique &#8364;&#339;L-shaped&#8364;? heat-sink designed to vastly improve the airflow inside the power supply, resulting in lower operating temperatures. Another unique feature to the Silent Pro Gold series is the Hybrid Transformer&#8222; which mounts the transformer directly to the heatsink.

Yet another feature that helps improve the power efficiency is Hyper Path&#8222; which is a &#8364;&#339;hyper link&#8364;? between the transformer and the various power conversion components. The &#8364;&#339;hyper link&#8364;? results in almost a loss-less transfer of energy which has never been done before. Combine all three of these features and you got one of the most quiet and power efficient power supplies in its category. The entire range offers a power efficiency that exceeds 90 percent at 220V, starting from a load of about 50 percent (model dependant), with some models never dropping below 90 percent. During normal use (up to about 50 percent load), neither model exceeds 21 dBA of fan noise thanks to the low RPM fan design combined with the new heat-sink design. Superb Performance Power efficiency and noise aside, the Silent Pro Gold series offers a wide range of cutting edge features. You will of course get modular cables and as with other high-end power supplies from Cooler Master and the Silent Pro Gold series is supplied with flat cables which allows for a much tidier build.

Intelligent cooling Shuttle's patented Heatpipe Cooling technology with variable speed control automatically ensures maximum system stability and quiet operation in this steel Shuttle Mini-PC. Instead of swirling around the chassis, as is the case with conventional solutions, the warm air is specifically transferred out of the chassis. Cleverly hidden In this model the ports and drives are hidden behind moveable panels that offer ideal protection from dust and ensure a clean, harmonious look. Not everyone needs to be able to see just what your Mini-PC can do. Optimal air flow Warm air is transported out of the chassis by means of cleverly arranged components, which enables a large number of parts to be cooled simultaneously in the air flow. At no time can heat build up and adversely affect the stability of the system. Communication in the fast lane The integrated gigabit LAN chipset opens up completely new possibilities for communication with no restriction on the speed of data transfer. Say goodbye to information bottlenecks, whether in the company network or for home Internet access. Ideal for expansion cards Although it's been around for quite some time now, the 32-bit PCI slot still remains a useful feature for connecting TV tuners, video capture cards and many other add-ons. PCI Express technology A fast X16-PCI-E slot enables the use of modern 3D graphics cards and other expansion cards that have to transfer huge amounts of data at ultra-rapid speeds. Almost limitless memory In this age of terabyte hard disks, four internal ports with SATA2 offer almost unlimited hard disk space. A major benefit here is that the Serial-ATA cables interfere far less with the air flow than PATA-Standard cables. External eSATA port With this interface external hard drives can reach the same speeds as inbuilt versions. Just give it a try. The latest generation of super-fast RAM In addition to a fast processor, high-performance PCs also require fast memory. This Shuttle Mini-PC offers DDR3-Triple-Channel RAM with up to 16 gigabytes of memory. Generous supply of USB ports You can never have enough of those versatile USB ports. This Shuttle Mini-PC offers 6 ports, with further ports for internal expansions located on the mainboard.

"Software","Microsoft ONENOTE 2007 AE Microsoft OneNote 2007. Academical Lisence OneNote 2007. Academical Lisence, EN, CD, Win32  Office OneNote 2007 is a digital notebook that provides people one place to gather their notes and information, powerful search to find what they are looking for quickly, and easy-to-use shared notebooks so that they can manage information overload and work together more effectively. Unlike paper-based systems, word processing programs, e-mail systems, or other productivity programs, Office OneNote 2007 delivers the flexibility to gather and organize text, pictures, digital handwriting, audio and video recordings, and more&#8364;&#8221;all in one digital notebook on your computer. Office OneNote 2007 can help you become more productive by keeping the information you need at your fingertips and reducing time spent searching for information across e-mail messages, paper notebooks, file folders, and printouts. Office OneNote 2007 is an integrated part of the 2007 Microsoft Office system that makes it easy to gather, organize, find, and share your notes and information more efficiently and effectively. Powerful search capabilities can help you locate information from text within pictures or from spoken words in audio and video recordings. And easy-to-use collaborative tools help teams work together with all of this information in shared notebooks, whether online or offline. With all of your information at your fingertips, Office OneNote 2007 provides you a solution for information overload, enables you to work with others more effectively, and helps you stay on top of tasks, schedules, and team information. The familiar look and feel of the Microsoft Office system makes it easy to start using the program right away, minimizing wasted time and training costs. Gather Everything in One Place With so much information coming your way&#8364;&#8221;and in so many different forms&#8364;&#8221;you need one place to keep it all and a tool that&#8364;&#8482;s flexible enough to capture it. Otherwise, information that could have been used to help make better decisions or make you more efficient is lost or difficult to find. Taking notes on paper and transcribing them later can be time-consuming and difficult. Paper notebooks get lost, you can&#8364;&#8482;t easily share them with others, and they are really only good for capturing one type of information: handwritten notes. Because most don&#8364;&#8482;t have a way of digitally capturing unstructured information, people often print out Web research, and store information in file folders or on desks, which is difficult to find later and inaccessible when you&#8364;&#8482;re away. And sharing information with others can be difficult&#8364;&#8221;people default to e-mail for file sharing and information exchange, and it&#8364;&#8482;s often hard to figure out what the plan is without reading through long e-mail threads. Office OneNote 2007 gives you a solution with a flexible software program that enables you to gather virtually any type of information in one place. With your information readily available, you can be more prepared and make better decisions. - Keep all your information all in one place&#8364;&#8221;including freeform notes, images, documents, files from other Microsoft Office system programs, and rich media&#8364;&#8221;and organize it in the way that works best for you. - Help protect intellectual property and don&#8364;&#8482;t worry about saving previous versions or creating backups of your information&#8364;&#8221;Office OneNote 2007 does this for you. - Take meeting notes in Office OneNote 2007 to create a living repository of group decisions and brainstorming sessions that adds continuity and context to subsequent meetings. - Catch all the details of customer calls and meetings by synchronizing typed or handwritten notes with Office OneNote 2007 audio and video recordings. - Gather information on your Microsoft Windows Mobile powered devices (including notes, recordings, and pictures) and transfer it to Office OneNote 2007. - Take advantage of the Office OneNote 2007 export application programming interfaces to easily transfer information gathered in OneNote 2007 to your company&#8364;&#8482;s business systems&#8364;&#8221;reduce errors and wasted time spent rekeying the same information in different systems. - Copy, paste, or print information from and into other 2007 Microsoft Office system programs including Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint. - Use Office OneNote 2007 drawing tools and tables to annotate and easily organize and manage information. Find What You're Looking For Quickly Finding information you need to do your job can take time. Searching for information in paper notes, file folders, computer files, or network shares takes valuable time away from your work and from your ability to positively affect your company. Time spent searching is not time spent working. With Office OneNote 2007, finding information is easy and fast. Office OneNote 2007 eliminates the guesswork of figuring out where you stored critical information because everything is kept in the same program. No more clicking through file folders and sorting through pages of paper notebooks to find the information you're looking for. Powerful search features give you the ability to locate information quickly. Office OneNote 2007 also allows you to search across new types of content, like text in scanned documents or images, and spoken words in audio and video recordings. With easier access to the facts, you and your teammates can make better decisions. - Search and find keywords quickly within text, in images, and in audio recordings made in Office OneNote 2007. - View hyperlinked search results in a summary task pane&#8364;&#8221;a single click takes you to relevant results. - View all open notebooks at once, use drag-and-drop functionality to easily arrange and rearrange your notes, and add hyperlinks to other pages in your notebook to quickly find relevant content. - Manage tasks easily with two-way synchronization between Office OneNote 2007 and the 2003 and 2007 versions of Microsoft Office Outlook. - Link notes and other information to specific Office Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2003 contacts to help you better prepare for meetings and recall information easily. - Mark notes with note flags, visually rich icons that make it easier to return to reminders, to-dos, and other action items. Work Together More Effectively With team members working from different locations and on multiple projects, communication, coordination, and information sharing can challenge group effectiveness and productivity. Teams often rely on e-mail messages to share files and information, causing file versioning issues and bloated e-mail inboxes. Tasks, action items, agendas, and issues stored within static documents or document management systems are difficult to update, track, and access, and they prevent multiple people from working with the same information at the same time. With each person storing and tracking information individually, it's difficult to get everyone working from the same page. Office OneNote 2007 helps people work together better by eliminating roadblocks that arise when information is isolated in paper notes or file folders, or on one person's computer. Groups can share information easily, work more productively, and keep track of projects, issues, and goals more effectively. - Work together from the same notebook&#8364;&#8221;whether online or offline&#8364;&#8221;using shared notebooks. Office OneNote 2007 manages changes made to the same notebook, eliminating the need to track versions or upload changes. - Create a team knowledge base so that everyone has access to the same information, helping to get new team members up to speed quickly, and minimizing duplicate efforts. - Share notes even with non-Office OneNote 2007 users&#8364;&#8221;by sending HTML-formatted files in e-mail messages or by publishing OneNote 2007 documents to Internet or intranet sites. - Stay in control of your information by choosing which notebooks to share with your teammates and which to keep private, and help ensure privacy with password protection. - Use Office OneNote 2007 as a shared digital whiteboard, enabling virtual teams to work together in real time, viewing and editing the same set of notes.

"Software","Microsoft ONENOTE 2007 Microsoft OneNote 2007 OneNote 2007, EN, CD, Win32  Office OneNote 2007 is a digital notebook that provides people one place to gather their notes and information, powerful search to find what they are looking for quickly, and easy-to-use shared notebooks so that they can manage information overload and work together more effectively. Unlike paper-based systems, word processing programs, e-mail systems, or other productivity programs, Office OneNote 2007 delivers the flexibility to gather and organize text, pictures, digital handwriting, audio and video recordings, and more&#8364;&#8221;all in one digital notebook on your computer. Office OneNote 2007 can help you become more productive by keeping the information you need at your fingertips and reducing time spent searching for information across e-mail messages, paper notebooks, file folders, and printouts. Office OneNote 2007 is an integrated part of the 2007 Microsoft Office system that makes it easy to gather, organize, find, and share your notes and information more efficiently and effectively. Powerful search capabilities can help you locate information from text within pictures or from spoken words in audio and video recordings. And easy-to-use collaborative tools help teams work together with all of this information in shared notebooks, whether online or offline. With all of your information at your fingertips, Office OneNote 2007 provides you a solution for information overload, enables you to work with others more effectively, and helps you stay on top of tasks, schedules, and team information. The familiar look and feel of the Microsoft Office system makes it easy to start using the program right away, minimizing wasted time and training costs. Gather Everything in One Place With so much information coming your way&#8364;&#8221;and in so many different forms&#8364;&#8221;you need one place to keep it all and a tool that&#8364;&#8482;s flexible enough to capture it. Otherwise, information that could have been used to help make better decisions or make you more efficient is lost or difficult to find. Taking notes on paper and transcribing them later can be time-consuming and difficult. Paper notebooks get lost, you can&#8364;&#8482;t easily share them with others, and they are really only good for capturing one type of information: handwritten notes. Because most don&#8364;&#8482;t have a way of digitally capturing unstructured information, people often print out Web research, and store information in file folders or on desks, which is difficult to find later and inaccessible when you&#8364;&#8482;re away. And sharing information with others can be difficult&#8364;&#8221;people default to e-mail for file sharing and information exchange, and it&#8364;&#8482;s often hard to figure out what the plan is without reading through long e-mail threads. Office OneNote 2007 gives you a solution with a flexible software program that enables you to gather virtually any type of information in one place. With your information readily available, you can be more prepared and make better decisions. - Keep all your information all in one place&#8364;&#8221;including freeform notes, images, documents, files from other Microsoft Office system programs, and rich media&#8364;&#8221;and organize it in the way that works best for you. - Help protect intellectual property and don&#8364;&#8482;t worry about saving previous versions or creating backups of your information&#8364;&#8221;Office OneNote 2007 does this for you. - Take meeting notes in Office OneNote 2007 to create a living repository of group decisions and brainstorming sessions that adds continuity and context to subsequent meetings. - Catch all the details of customer calls and meetings by synchronizing typed or handwritten notes with Office OneNote 2007 audio and video recordings. - Gather information on your Microsoft Windows Mobile powered devices (including notes, recordings, and pictures) and transfer it to Office OneNote 2007. - Take advantage of the Office OneNote 2007 export application programming interfaces to easily transfer information gathered in OneNote 2007 to your company&#8364;&#8482;s business systems&#8364;&#8221;reduce errors and wasted time spent rekeying the same information in different systems. - Copy, paste, or print information from and into other 2007 Microsoft Office system programs including Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint. - Use Office OneNote 2007 drawing tools and tables to annotate and easily organize and manage information. Find What You're Looking For Quickly Finding information you need to do your job can take time. Searching for information in paper notes, file folders, computer files, or network shares takes valuable time away from your work and from your ability to positively affect your company. Time spent searching is not time spent working. With Office OneNote 2007, finding information is easy and fast. Office OneNote 2007 eliminates the guesswork of figuring out where you stored critical information because everything is kept in the same program. No more clicking through file folders and sorting through pages of paper notebooks to find the information you're looking for. Powerful search features give you the ability to locate information quickly. Office OneNote 2007 also allows you to search across new types of content, like text in scanned documents or images, and spoken words in audio and video recordings. With easier access to the facts, you and your teammates can make better decisions. - Search and find keywords quickly within text, in images, and in audio recordings made in Office OneNote 2007. - View hyperlinked search results in a summary task pane&#8364;&#8221;a single click takes you to relevant results. - View all open notebooks at once, use drag-and-drop functionality to easily arrange and rearrange your notes, and add hyperlinks to other pages in your notebook to quickly find relevant content. - Manage tasks easily with two-way synchronization between Office OneNote 2007 and the 2003 and 2007 versions of Microsoft Office Outlook. - Link notes and other information to specific Office Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2003 contacts to help you better prepare for meetings and recall information easily. - Mark notes with note flags, visually rich icons that make it easier to return to reminders, to-dos, and other action items. Work Together More Effectively With team members working from different locations and on multiple projects, communication, coordination, and information sharing can challenge group effectiveness and productivity. Teams often rely on e-mail messages to share files and information, causing file versioning issues and bloated e-mail inboxes. Tasks, action items, agendas, and issues stored within static documents or document management systems are difficult to update, track, and access, and they prevent multiple people from working with the same information at the same time. With each person storing and tracking information individually, it's difficult to get everyone working from the same page. Office OneNote 2007 helps people work together better by eliminating roadblocks that arise when information is isolated in paper notes or file folders, or on one person's computer. Groups can share information easily, work more productively, and keep track of projects, issues, and goals more effectively. - Work together from the same notebook&#8364;&#8221;whether online or offline&#8364;&#8221;using shared notebooks. Office OneNote 2007 manages changes made to the same notebook, eliminating the need to track versions or upload changes. - Create a team knowledge base so that everyone has access to the same information, helping to get new team members up to speed quickly, and minimizing duplicate efforts. - Share notes even with non-Office OneNote 2007 users&#8364;&#8221;by sending HTML-formatted files in e-mail messages or by publishing OneNote 2007 documents to Internet or intranet sites. - Stay in control of your information by choosing which notebooks to share with your teammates and which to keep private, and help ensure privacy with password protection. - Use Office OneNote 2007 as a shared digital whiteboard, enabling virtual teams to work together in real time, viewing and editing the same set of notes.

Supports PDF versions 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and ISO PDF/A. Support for PDF packages Wrap-up multiple documents and file types into a single PDF package. Managing document security and transferring files has never been easier. PDF-A Support The PDF-A archiving standard ensures today's PDF files will be able to display and print appropriately for years to come. A new PDF-A button can turn any PDF file into the archive format instantly. Creates PDF files that are compliant with the new public specification from the International Standards Organization, 19005-1 PDF/A.

Supports industry-standard compression options, including loss-less, JPEG 2000 and enables optimization for the Web. PDF File Size Optimizer The PDF Optimizer allows you to minimize the size of files without compromising the quality. A host of size reduction approaches from down sampling, to compression, and unembedding fonts, allow documents to be ideally sized for sharing and archiving. PDF Create Assistant The PDF Create Assistant makes it a breeze to batch process documents and set up profiles so you have batch settings pre-configured for different types of documents. Passwords and Security Secure PDF files by requiring others to know a password in order to view or print a document. 40-bit and 128-bit encryption can also be applied to a PDF file with the user able to control whether the document can be viewed, printed, edited, copied or annotated.

You can also merge multiple documents into a single PDF file page-by-page, which is ideal for merging letter text into a letterhead template document, or to merge form data into a form template. Watermarks and Stamps Apply watermarks and stamps to your documents from a pre-made library or create your own. Custom watermarks can be applied from other PDF files or created from within the PDF Create Assistant.

Great low-light performance is assured by a 4-stop Image Stabilizer. Compact, fast and lightweight The EF-S 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 IS is a compact, EF-S lens with high magnification &#8364;&#8220; approx. 11x. It features an 18-200mm zoom ratio (the 35mm film equivalent focal length is 29-320mm) and has a maximum aperture of f/3.5-5.6. Designed to appeal to entry-level and advanced amateur users looking for a lens with an optical Image Stabilizer and large focal length range, it weighs just 595g and measures 78.6 x 102mm. The lens offers 0.45m minimum focusing distance at all zoom position. The EF-S 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 IS is designed exclusively for use with EOS cameras featuring an EF-S lens mount &#8364;&#8220; including the EOS 50D, EOS 1000D, EOS 450D, and earlier models. Aspheric and UD elements High image quality has been assured with the addition of two high-precision aspheric lenses to correct aberration including curvature of field and distortion. Chromatic aberration common in wide-angle shooting is also combated by the inclusion of two UD lenses, ensuring optimum image quality and corner-to-corner detail. Super-Spectra coating Canon&#8364;&#8482;s patented lens element coating minimises the ghosting and flare caused by reflections off the camera image sensor and internal lens surfaces. Light transmission is improved and reflections are reduced to deliver clear crisp images. 4-stop Image Stabilizer A 4-stop optical Image Stabilizer &#8364;&#8220; specially designed for the lens&#8364;&#8482; specific focal length range &#8364;&#8220; works to counteract image blur, which can occur during handheld shooting, or at slow shutter speeds. Automatic panning detection ensures effective performance when tracking moving subjects. And, as the IS system is based in the lens, results are visible through the viewfinder during framing. Durable build quality and Lead-free optics Designed to be a hard-working lens the EF-S 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 IS benefits from a robust design, which can match the demands of today&#8364;&#8482;s photographers.

"Consumer Electronics","Canon Battery Pack BP-511A - Battery Pack BP-511A for EOS 5D EOS 50D &amp; EOS 40D Canon BP-511A BP-511A  BP-511's are lithium-ion batteries, and as such can be recharged safely at any charge state without significantly reducing the effective life. Some batteries (like those in the 1D) must be periodically discharged completely to maintain battery life. This is not necessary for the BP-511. The storage capacity of lithium-ion battery packs decreases gradually with use. Typically, the BP-511 can handle about 300-400 full discharge/recharge cycles without a noticeable loss of capacity. After that, performance, as measured in the number of shots per charge, decreases quickly and the battery pack becomes unusable. The battery level displays in EOS DSLRs that use BP-511's change their readouts in 4 steps (full, half empty, blinking, nothing) based on specific voltage levels, which explains why limited shooting can produce a dramatic change in read-out. Lithium-ion battery packs, like most other secondary (i.e., rechargeable) batteries, very typically ""recover"" to a slightly higher voltage level when allowed to rest for a short period after use. This characteristic is different from primary (non-rechargeable) batteries like standard AA alkaline cells - again explaining why the meter reading may change for the same battery after it's been sat in a warm pocket for a while. When two BP-511 battery packs are installed in the BG-ED3, the camera draws from the pack with the higher voltage level first until it equals the level of the other battery pack, then both packs are drained simultaneously. In a recent post, Chuck has confirmed that there is no difference in battery drain whether the camera is off or on provided neither of the LCDs is active. Once the metering display has turned itself off after the requisite six seconds, you can just rely on the shutter button to wake the 10D up rather than turn the camera off and be forced to endure the several seconds' boot-up procedure.

Features - L-series optics. - Light and compact. - 4-stop Image Stabilizer. - f/4 through zoom range. - Fluorite and UD lens elements. - Fast auto focus. - Environmental seals. - Super Spectra coatings. - Circular aperture for pleasing background blur. - Soft case and lens hood. The professional&#8364;&#8482;s lightweight IS telephoto zoom. 4-stop IS The EF 70-200mm f/4L IS USM features the world's first 4-stop Image Stabilizer (IS). Ideal for handheld work, the exceptionally accurate and sensitive IS negates the need for a tripod in many conditions. Shutter speeds up to 4 stops slower than would be otherwise possible (e.g. 1/15 sec instead of 1/200) can be used with no perceptible increase in image blur. For stabilised panning, IS Mode 2 corrects only for unwanted vertical shake. L-series quality The lens embodies Canon&#8364;&#8482;s highest standards of L-series optics, build quality, reliability and operability. Crisp, high contrast image quality is assured right across the frame and throughout the entire zoom range. A reliable partner in tough conditions, the metal and polycarbonate construction features special environmental seals to prevent the ingress of dust and moisture. Lightweight With a length of just 172mm and weighing only 760g, the EF 70-200mm f/4L IS USM is ideal for assignments where there is a need to travel light without compromising performance, operability or image quality. Fixed aperture With no change in aperture over the full focal length range, photographers can set exposure at the widest aperture and zoom through to 200mm without slowing shutter speed. Lens length remains constant during zooming and focusing. Fluorite and UD lens elements The lens incorporates a single Fluorite and two UD (ultra-low dispersion glass) lens elements to suppress secondary chromatic aberrations. The result is crisp, high contrast, undistorted images throughout the entire zoom range, without colour fringing at subject outlines. Auto focus A Ring-type USM (Ultrasonic motor) delivers responsive, high-speed, silent auto focus. Holding torque is excellent, stopping the focus lens group with precision and without overshoot. Full time manual focus override is available without switching out of AF. Minimum focus distance is 1.2m throughout the zoom range. Super Spectra coatings Optimised Super Spectra coatings and lens element shaping suppress flare and ghosting. Coatings also help achieve true colour balance and increase contrast. Pleasing background blur The Electro Magnetic Diaphragm (EMD) features an almost perfectly circular aperture to create an even and attractive blur from out-of-focus backgrounds.

"Software","Nuance Dragon NS Premium V11 Dutch Nuance Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11 Premium, NL Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11 Premium, NL, Box, Microsoft Windows 7/Vista/XP/2003  From improved accuracy and faster performance, to an intuitive user interface with a rich Help system, powerful new voice commands, and an enhanced correction and adaptation process, Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11 has been redesigned to be FASTER, BETTER and SIMPLY SMARTER. The Dragon user interface now offers better usability, and includes a new Sidebar showing tips as well as many commands. It&#8364;&#8482;s now easier to discover, remember, and access important Dragon features and options. New Recognition Analytics continuously monitor audio quality and alert users when there is an audio issue, to help them achieve their best accuracy. More than ever, Dragon 11 enables users to focus on their thoughts and ideas rather than the mouse, keyboard or computer screen. Dragon 11 is more accurate out of the box than version 10, and uses state-of-the-art technology. Thanks to improvements at various levels, corrections are faster to make, and quickly become less necessary. Version 11 &#8364;&#339;learns&#8364;? better than any previous version, including from existing documents and dictations as well as from corrections made via the keyboard. Dragon 11 responds faster to voice commands and also introduces new time-saving commands that consolidate multiple mouse clicks and keystrokes. It&#8364;&#8482;s faster and easier to open applications, get to a particular window, move within a window, send e-mail, create appointments, search the Web, and more &#8364;&#8220; all by voice. So now users can get even more done faster on their computers. Improved Accuracy - Reduced Word Recognition Errors: Dragon 11 significantly improved recognition accuracy and can reduce recognition errors up to 15% compared with Dragon 10. This means Dragon 11 recognizes speech more accurately right out of the box so users will spend less time correcting recognition errors. - Smart Configuration: Dragon 11 runs on a variety of hardware, from small netbooks to high-powered servers. Dragon automatically detects hardware resources and sets up the recommended configuration. Dragon&#8364;&#8482;s state-of-the-art technology takes advantage of advances in hardware and runs in multiple-threads automatically when multi-core hardware is detected to achieve better recognition performance. - Easy Scheduling of Accuracy Tuning: This automatic process plays a large role in improving a user&#8364;&#8482;s accuracy from his or her own usage,since it adapts the profile based on what dictations and corrections have already been done. It must run at a time when the computer is on, but the user is not dictating. In version 11, scheduling Accuracy Tuning no longer requires a Windows password, so the user can easily choose a time and frequency that fit his or her schedule. Similarly, no password is required to schedule the Data Collection process (which periodically sends to Nuance anonymous usage data to improve the accuracy of future updates of Dragon). - Recognition Analytics: Because a significant percentage of misrecognitions can be caused by simple audio quality issues such as incorrect microphone connection or placement, background noise, and Bluetooth microphone out of range or low on battery, Dragon now automatically detects poor audio input; it then alerts the user (in various ways depending on the issue), offering advice to remedy the situation. This lets Dragon use the best audio possible -- an important factor for accuracy. Faster Recognition Response for Commands and Dictation - Faster Response Times: Dragon 11 improved recognition response time significantly. It is also faster than previous editions when selecting application menu items by voice or executing voice commands that perform actions within applications (e.g., ""insert page break,"" ""make that red,"" etc.) New User Interface - Dictate faster and more efficiently: Dragon quickly processes the recognition of speech in the background, and instead of the Results box of previous versions, displays only a discreet indicator that recognition is in progress; this encourages continuous speech, an important factor for accuracy. Novice users are no longer distracted by watching the preliminary recognition results pooling and changing within the Results Box before text is inserted into the document. (The traditional Results box is still available as an option.) - New Dragon Sidebar: A major enhancement over Version 10&#8364;&#8482;s Sample Commands window, this new desktop assistant allows users to discover and remember many commands and tips; at any time, it lets you glance at or explore global commands (including mouse commands), application-specific commands and custom-created commands, as well as tips. The Dragon Sidebar is a thin, resizable and dockable window that can be placed anywhere on the Windows desktop. Its contents change depending on what window is currently active. In addition, the Sidebar lets users print its content. - Richer Help system: The redesigned Accuracy Center (accessible from the Help menu) now gathers all important tools and options, with brief descriptions of key items to help discovery. The Help system also incorporate new tips and illustrations, a redesigned Tutorial, short videos, and easy access to related details such as a glossary of key terms. Finding relevant information is faster and easier thanks also to icon links on the Dragon Sidebar and contextual links on dialog boxes &#8364;&#8220; as well as new voice shortcuts you can speak at any time (&#8364;&#339;Search Dragon Help for&#8364;&#8364;?). - More usable toolbar (the DragonBar): The naming and organization of items on the DragonBar now allow users to discover and quickly access important but often-overlooked Dragon features, such as the Vocabulary Editor, the analysis of specific documents, scheduled tasks, and recognition modes (Dictation Mode, Numbers Mode, etc..). Now docked to the top of the screen by default, the DragonBar gathers in one area all its indicators: icons and written messages. - Text Control Indicator on the DragonBar: This checkmark icon on the DragonBar indicates whether Dragon currently has ""Full Text Control"" for the active text field. Formerly called &#8364;&#339;Select-and-Say&#8364;?, &#8364;&#339;Full Text Control&#8364;? enables capabilities such as the use, at anytime, of commands that quote words from the text (&#8364;&#339;Select&#8364;&#8364;?, &#8364;&#339;Correct&#8364;&#8364;?, &#8364;&#339;Delete&#8364;&#8364;?, &#8364;&#339;Insert Before&#8364;&#8364;?). When the insertion point is in a field for which Dragon does not have Full Text Control, Dragon dims this checkmark icon and writes a message in the DragonBar; this informs the user that he or she may wish to dictate via Dragon&#8364;&#8482;s Dictation Box which gives access to Dragon&#8364;&#8482;s full capabilities to edit and correct text (as in previous versions). Time-Saving Voice Commands - More Dragon Voice Shortcuts: Dragon 11 includes more commands than ever to consolidate multiple mouse clicks and keystrokes into a direct voice command that can be spoken anytime -- no matter what is active on the screen. Users can now use the ""search [website] for [XYZ]"" commands to make precise searches in Facebook.com, Twitter, IRS.gov, MySpace.com, as well as the Nuance technical knowledgebase website. Dragon 11 also lets users voice keyword searches in its Help topics (&#8364;&#339;Search Dragon Help for [XYZ]&#8364;?), and includes new voice shortcuts that make it faster and easier to manage email, tasks and meetings. - Navigating the Computer Desktop: Dragon now supports more voice commands to show common Windows elements including the desktop and Control Panel, or folders such as My Documents and My Pictures. New commands enable users to effortlessly switch to a specific window (Dragon displays a numbered list so the user can just say the number of the desired window.) In addition, Dragon 11 allows shorter names for starting popular applications (e.g., ""start Microsoft Word"" instead of &#8364;&#339;start Microsoft Office Word 2007&#8364;?). - Navigating Documents: Dragon 11 allows users to scroll up or down pages within programs including Word, Outlook, Excel, and more, with the same command wordings such as &#8364;&#339;Start scrolling down,&#8364;? &#8364;&#339;Speed up&#8364;? and &#8364;&#339;Stop scrolling.&#8364;? - More Precise Keyword Searching: For its search shortcut commands, Dragon 11 now applies its autoformatting rules to the dictated search keywords (the XYZ in &#402;&#402;&#8218;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;&#8364;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;&#339;Search &#402;&#402;&#8218;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;&#8364;&#402;&#8218;&#8218; for XYZ&#402;&#402;&#8218;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;&#8364;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;?). In addition, it gives the user the option to edit or augment the search string before launching the search (without this option, the user must say the entire search command in one utterance: Dragon will launch the search as soon as it hears a pause). These enhancements can save a lot of time, since the more precise your search string, the faster you find exactly what you need. Getting Started with Dragon is Faster and Easier Faster and Easier to Create a User Profile: User profile creation has been redesigned to be simple and conversational. The process now offers information about why each step is needed and helps users make optimal choices. Setting up a microphone or new audio source is more clear and straightforward. Local Settings: During user profile creation, users can now select their region of the world so that Dragon can automatically use regional formatting for dates, currency, etc. New Text Options to &#402;&#402;&#8218;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;&#8364;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;&#339;Train&#402;&#402;&#8218;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;&#8364;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;? Dragon: Dragon 11 provides simplified training texts designed to make the reading experience easier and more informative. Easier than Ever to Use Dragon with a Digital Voice Recorder (not available for Dragon Home) - Initial Training Time Reduced for Recorders: Creating a new user profile for a digital recorder, or adding a digital recorder as a new audio source for an existing user profile, is now much faster: the minimum reading time required to train Dragon with a recorder has been reduced from 15 to 4 minutes. - Ability to Use .DSS and .DS2 Files: Dragon 11 can now accept .dss and .ds2 formats directly. Files recorded using these digital speech recording formats (found on recorders from Olympus, Grundig and Philips) previously required conversion prior to transcription. Improved Playback - Smoother fast-forward and rewind behaviors are now available and users now have options to control speed and volume Enhanced Hardware and Software Support - Netbook Computers: Users can now comfortably view the Dragon user interface and tutorials on netbook (mini notebook) computers. - Office 2010: Dragon 11 is compatible with Microsoft Office 2010 applications. Full Text Control, Menu Tracking, and Natural Language Commands are supported for Word 2010, Outlook 2010, and Excel 2010 allowing users to take full advantage of Dragon dictation and commands in these new applications. - OpenOffice Writer: Support includes dictation, correction, selection, and playback. Additional Usability Enhancements - Require &#402;&#402;&#8218;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;&#8364;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;&#339;Click&#402;&#402;&#8218;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;&#8364;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;? to Select Hyperlinks: This option is now enabled by default so that, while in a Web page, users don&#402;&#402;&#8218;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;&#8364;&#402;&#8218;&#8218;&#8482;t experience unexpected actions upon saying a short phrase which is also the name of a hyperlink on the page. - Enhanced Open User Dialog for Large Sites (Pro +): Displays profiles in a tree structure for faster access to multiple profiles.

Reliable - When it comes to data protection, it's safety first. Tape has proved itself a reliable medium, and tape drives themselves have never been more reliable Data loss is a serious threat to companies of all sizes, and catastrophic data loss can destroy a business. But most data loss isn't the result of a big disaster, it's caused by human error, viruses, and disk malfunctions. A suitable backup routine provides the best protection against data loss of all kinds. And tape technology remains the most efficient and cost-effective means to back up your system, whether you're a small business or a global 24x7 operation. tape drives make backup : Fast - Speed is critical because your data is constantly growing while the time available for backup is shrinking. Even the slowest tape drive writes 1 MB per second and the fastest 30 MB per second - that means a 200 GB backup can be completed in less than two hours. Easy - Unlike other storage methods, tape drives offer a range of media that allows you to back up all the data on a small to medium-sized server - up to 200 GB - on a single cartridge. And tape backup captures your system setup information, as well as your data, allowing you to restore your entire system when disaster strikes. What's more, your software can schedule backups to happen automatically at the time most convenient for you. Affordable - Per gigabyte of storage, tape is the most cost-effective way to store large amounts of data. The compact size of tape cartridges also helps keep down your storage costs.

The latest top of the range graphics cards from both ATI and Nvidia are demanding more power than ever before and the latest flagship motherboards are equally demanding once you start pushing the limits of your system by overclocking it. The new Silent Pro Gold series from Cooler Master addresses all of these problems while maintaining &#8364;&#8220; or even exceeding &#8364;&#8220; an extraordinary 90 percent power efficiency under load at 220V, which gains it an 80 Plus Gold certification. Innovative and Patented Technologies The Silent Pro Gold series features an entirely new design with several innovative and patented technologies. Cooler Master has created HTT&#8222; (Heat Transfer Technology), a unique &#8364;&#339;L-shaped&#8364;? heat-sink designed to vastly improve the airflow inside the power supply, resulting in lower operating temperatures. Another unique feature to the Silent Pro Gold series is the Hybrid Transformer&#8222; which mounts the transformer directly to the heatsink. This makes for a more compact transformer and improves the power efficiency at the same time. Yet another feature that helps improve the power efficiency is Hyper Path&#8222; which is a &#8364;&#339;hyper link&#8364;? between the transformer and the various power conversion components. The &#8364;&#339;hyper link&#8364;? results in almost a loss-less transfer of energy which has never been done before. Combine all three of these features and you got one of the most quiet and power efficient power supplies in its category. The entire range offers a power efficiency that exceeds 90 percent at 220V, starting from a load of about 50 percent (model dependant), with some models never dropping below 90 percent. During normal use (up to about 50 percent load), neither model exceeds 21 dBA of fan noise thanks to the low RPM fan design combined with the new heat-sink design. Superb Performance Power efficiency and noise aside, the Silent Pro Gold series offers a wide range of cutting edge features. You will of course get modular cables and as with other high-end power supplies from Cooler Master and the Silent Pro Gold series is supplied with flat cables which allows for a much tidier build. Some models also features a cable protector for the main ATX power cable on the PSU end which reduces wear and tear where this large cable enters the PSU chassis. "

Shinano Kenshi Corporation was founded in 1918 to manufacture Spun Silk Yarn, which at the time was one of the most ""High-Tech"" industries in the world. The silk required a very delicate and precise production process. The right to wear silk was reserved for the highest government officials and dignitaries only, and therefore the quality standards were extremely high. In these circumstances, Shinano Kenshi developed their own business philosophy: &#8364;&#339;Never Compromise, Always Think Quality&#8364;?, because only providing the best quality could satisfy their exceptional customers. As the years passed, Shinano Kenshi embarked on other industrial markets that would grow more progressively, while maintaining its proud history in the Silk Industry. In the 1960s, Shinano Kenshi decided to diversify its business to electric motors, a fast growing market at the time. Despite changing its core business, the company kept its business philosophy, &#8364;&#339;Never Compromise, Always Think Quality&#8364;?. These ventures insights led to the successful expansion into technology-driven, knowledge-intensive fields, such as Electrical Division, Electronic Equipment Division and Printing Equipment Division. In the 1980&#8364;&#8482;s, Shinano Kenshi expanded their sub-contracting position by recognizing the evolution of the digital age with the advancement of compact discs replacing the older generation of analog tapes. The company began to manufacture their own compact disc players for the audio industry, and developed a separate brand for the department. The Electronic Equipment Division introduced its first CD-ROM optical disk drive under the TEXEL brand name in 1989. Faced with the prospects of a healthy and ever-increasing demand for its products, Shinano Kenshi identified the importance of this segment, with the Professional and IT markets demanding performance-oriented products. The company naturally transitioned into the optical disc drive industry. Through every generation of optical disk drives, Plextor has continually sought ways in which its CD-ROM's, CD-RW's and DVD+R/RW's could stimulate market demand by offering higher speed and higher reliability devices, while winning numerous awards worldwide. While maintaining and strengthening its core competences, Shinano Kenshi continued its global expansion by establishing subsidiary companies and promoting its products on a worldwide basis. In 1982 Shinano Kenshi began to expand overseas. The United States was the first country where the company started overseas operation. PLEXTOR US was officially founded in 1990 and three years later a European branch (PLEXTOR EU) was opened. The subsidiaries are chartered with the continual growth of Resellers and OEM's in their respective territories, who have come to rely upon Shinano Kenshi for performance, quality oriented and technically superior optical peripheral products. In 1994, Shinano Kenshi announced their new brand name PLEXTOR for their digital technology products, including optical disc drives. Plextor CD-R/RW drives were introduced in 1998 with technologies developed by the corporation in support of the market growing demand for CD-ROM's. DVD+R/RW were added to the Plextor product line in 2003. High performance drives enable our users to write and re-write data on a stable platform that has evolved throughout the years. Plextor has also invested heavily on the certification of media to give our users a wide range of compatibility between the various manufacturers. Plextor's CD-R, CD-RW and DVD+R/RW optical disk drives have been tested worldwide and evaluated as the ""Professional Choice"" to satisfy even the most discerning customers. Plextor products have been adopted by financial institutions and government agencies, which require highly reliable data storage technology. Recording studios have come to regard the Plextor products as the ""drive of choice,"" which they can rely upon for the accurate extraction and creation of Digital Audio. The business philosophy &#8364;&#339;Never Compromise, Always think Quality&#8364;? generated from tailoring luxury silk for the highest dignitaries did not fade over time but became the company&#8364;&#8482;s core value. Also in the optical storage business, Plextor provided the best quality products to high-end customers and professional users in a heavy duty environment, instead of general users. In order to satisfy these professional users and to meet their strict specifications, PLEXTOR always invested many resources in R and product testing before any product was released to the market. In line with its high quality standards, Plextor always offered excellent warranty conditions. In the 21st century PLEXOR successfully entered new markets with external Hard Disks, Multi Media Players, Network Attached Storage, and more to come&#8364;.. "

"Network & Comms","DYNAMODE ADSL modem filter Dynamode M-ADSL-FILTER network splitter M-ADSL-FILTER  The M-ADSL-Filter has been specifically designed to implement the functionality of a low pass filter using G.Lite Technology. This technology is similar to full rate ADSL but operates at a lower data rate of up to 1.5Mbps downstream and 512Kbps upstream, depending on line conditions and lengths. M-ADSL-Filter is a lower speed alternative version of ADSL that will eliminate the need for telecom to install and maintain a premises based POTS splitter. It was found necessary to include one or more, low pass filters in series with the POTS terminals in order to reliably achieve maximum data rates. For POTS voice band service, the M-ADSLFilter provides protection from ADSL signals, which may impact through non-line or other remote devices (handset, fax, voice band modem etc) and central office operations. For ADSL signals, it also provides protection from the high frequency transient and impedance effect that occur during POTS operations (ringing transients, on-hook, off-hook transient and so on). Because the POTS splitter in the M-ADSL-Filter connects directly to the subscriber loop media, it also provides some protection for externally induced line hits or faults which could damage any attached equipment or endanger people interacting with the installed equipment. The circuit protection will be provided mostly by standard central office line protection means and additional protection measures built into the POTS splitter to protect against line overstress, which could damage the splitter itself.

Powered by Intel 1.6 GHz CPU, 1GB DDRII memory, the TS-439 Pro delivers superior performance for multiple business applications. Advanced RAID configurations, including RAID 0/ 1/ 5/ 6/ 5+Spare, JBOD, Online RAID Capacity Expansion, and Online RAID Level Migration are all supported. The TS-439 Pro supports file sharing across Linux, UNIX, Mac, and Windows platforms. Different applications are supported, e.g. file server, FTP server, printer server, web server, and encrypted remote replication. Also, Windows AD (Active Directory) is supported to help create an easy-to-access environment and lower the maintenance cost. SSH login and web page SSL login enable users to transfer, store, and share data securely. The TS-439 Pro can serve as a NAS and an iSCSI target server. The built-in iSCSI target feature provides an affordable IP-SAN (Storage Area Network) alternative for SMB. You can set up the NAS to expand the storage capacity for existing application servers, such as database server and mail server in an economic way. Moreover, the ""Virtual Space Allocation"" (Thin Provisioning) feature is provided which allows you to flexibly allocate the capacity of iSCSI LUN (Logical Unit Number) at the beginning regardless of the physical volume capacity. The TS-439 Pro's dominant ""volume-based encryption"" feature secures the server data by AES 256-bit encryption. Even if the hard drives were stolen, there is no need to fear that the confidential data would be leaked since the data can only be accessed by an authorized password. The handy LCD display on the NAS provides a speedy and easy approach to initialize the NAS and set up the RAID configuration without using any computer. The system information and settings are also displayed for easy management. The schedule power on/off feature is available on the NAS for you to flexibly manage the NAS server's up time according to the working hours. Also, the smart Wake on LAN is supported for convenient remote wakeup of the NAS in the local network. You can use the handy LCD to finish the first time installation in 3 simple steps. The NAS will automatically complete the hard disk formatting and RAID building. The dual LAN ports can be configured as failover which allows the NAS server to sustain the failure of one network port to provide continuous services. The two LAN ports of the NAS can be configured as load balancing mode for bandwidth aggregation to boost the file transfer speed (works with managed Ethernet switch with 802.3ad configured). The NAS can be deployed with two IP settings for sharing among different workgroups in two different subnets. All the OS and applications are embedded on the DOM. The NAS allows system booting without accessing the physical disk sectors and that avoids unsuccessful system startup caused by bad block sectors or file errors on the hard drives. Two operating systems are built on the DOM for system booting alternatively upon every system startup. When one fails, the other one will be used to boot up instead, and the failed OS is recoverable from the other healthy OS.  hr width=""100%"" size=""1"" / Features Device Type: NAS server Host Connectivity: Hi-Speed USB / Gigabit Ethernet / eSATA-300 Total Storage Capacity: 0 GB Installed Devices / Modules Qty: 0 (installed) / 4 (max) Dimensions (WxDxH): 18 cm x 23.5 cm x 17.7 cm Weight: 3.7 kg Processor: 1 x Intel 1.6 GHz Storage Controller: RAID - Serial ATA-300 - RAID 0, 1, 5, 6, JBOD, 5 hot spare Hard Drive: Hot-swap Serial ATA-300 Networking: Network adapter - integrated - Gigabit Ethernet Power: AC 120/230 V ( 50 - 60 Hz ) Storage Operating System: Linux System Requirements: Apple MacOS X, Microsoft Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP, Microsoft Windows Vista, Microsoft Windows 2003 "

Wattage and heat go hand-in-hand. Other PSUs claim a certain wattage by using unrealistic testing environments like 25C, but in real settings, they might reach much lower wattages. XFX PSUs guarantee the advertised wattage, even at well above standard operating conditions at 50C. Power drawn from your AC outlet is typically dirty with voltage spikes and fluctuations, which can harm vital PC components. XFX PSUs are designed to deliver tight DC voltage regulation with minimal AC ripple, giving you safer, cleaner power. 80 Plus Platinum certified means that this XFX PSU has a power efficiency of up to 92%. Compare that to non-certified PSUs, which lose at least 20% of power drawn. With the XFX PSU, get every watt you pay for. Internal PC operating temperature is around 35C but the internal PSU temperature can be much higher.  Summary: XFX uses all high-quality Japanese brand capacitors rated to withstand up to 105C. While some competitors claim to use Japanese capacitors, they may only be rated for 85C, which can shorten the usable life of a PSU. All XFX PSUs come with automatic output protection systems to protect you and your computer. This includes Total Power Protection (OPP), Over Voltage Protection (OVP), Over Current Protection (OCP) and Short Circuit Protection (SCP).

If still under warranty, APC will then replace your damaged SurgeArrest free of charge. Overload Indicator Indicator illuminates when connected equipment draws more power than unit&#8364;&#8482;s capacity. To remedy the condition, unplug less vital equipment. Right Angle Plug Plug angle allows for equipment and furniture to be placed closer to the wall than with a standard power cord. Reduces cord stress too. IEEE let-through ratings and regulatory agency compliance Stringent third-party testing gives you confidence that APC's surge protectors will safeguard your equipment and data from potentially damaging surges and spikes. AV Surge Protectors Features & Benefits Safety Building Wiring Fault Indicator Immediately warns you of wiring problems like improper grounds that could cause shocks or prevent adequately suppressing surges. Catastrophic Event Protection SurgeArrest components such as MOVs and Thermal fuse ensure instantaneous reaction to lightning strikes and wiring faults. If the surge components are damaged due to power spike or over voltage, excess power cannot reach your equipment. Unlike the APC SurgeArrest products, most surge suppressors continue to let power through even after circuits have been damaged, leaving your equipment exposed to other damaging surges. Fail Safe Mode Most other surge suppressors continue to let power through even after their circuits have been damaged, leaving your equipment exposed to future surges. APC&#8364;&#8482;s SurgeArrest fail safe, which means that once the circuit of an APC SurgeArrest has been compromised the unit disconnects equipment from the power supply ensuring that no damaging surges reach your equipment. IEEE let-through rating and UL 1449 compliance The 'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) Let-Through Voltage rating is based on a test that subjects a Surge Protector to a 6,000 volt spike. The rating equates to the amount of excess voltage that reaches connected equipment. The lower the number, the better the performance of the Surge Protector is. Underwriter's Laboratory's UL1449 surge protection safety standard uses these ratings to help users gauge performance. UL's best Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor (TVSS) Let-Through Voltage rating is ""300V"". Protection Noise Filtering Attenuates EMI/RFI line noise that can cause data errors and keyboard lockups, ensuring better performance of protected equipment. "

The cameras can detect moving objects in total darkness, for distances of up to 30 or 50 meters.2 Equipped with a high-resolution Sony CCD image sensor, these cameras provide you with excellent image quality and level of detail. A built-in Infrared Cut Removable (ICR) filter in the DCS-7510 allows the camera to capture images in both good light and low light conditions by switching the infrared cut filter. Embedded with a powerful SoC (System-on-Chip), the cameras provide high-quality, real-time video compression in MPEG-4 and motion JPEG formats. These elements make the DCS-7410/7510 an ideal solution for 24-hour surveillance. VARIFOCAL LENS FOR FLEXIBLE SURVEILLANCE The DCS-7510 is equipped with a varifocal 9~22mm lens that allows you to manually change the focus length on desired objects. With a shorter focal length you will get a wider field of view, whereas a longer focal length narrows the field of view and allows you to zoom in more on the images. The focus and zoom controls are located on the outside of the camera case for easy adjustments. This camera also has an auto-iris that automatically adjusts the exposure according to the light conditions for optimum picture quality. WIRED PoE ACCESS For easy installation at high places, the cameras come with built-in 802.3af compliant Power over Ethernet (PoE), giving users the freedom to place the camera anywhere by eliminating the need for a nearby power outlet. VIEW LIVE VIDEO FROM A 3G MOBILE PHONE3 A live feed from the camera can be accessed on a 3G mobile network by using a compatible mobile phone or PDA with a 3G video player. Anywhere within the 3GPP service area, users have a flexible and convenient way to remotely monitor a home or office in real time. WEATHERPROOF HOUSING The cameras are housed in an IP66 certified weatherproof casing, which protects them against rain and dust. An adjustable top shields the camera sensor from direct sunlight while providing air ventilation for the camera. The wire-in bracket design tightly assembles and protects the cables not only from outdoor wear and tear, but also from criminal acts such as intentional cable cutting. INTELLIGENT & EASY TO USE The bundled D-ViewCam software allows you to manage and record videos to a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device such as the D-Link DNS-323. Alternatively, you can record videos to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), such as the D-Link DNS-722-4 or DNS-726-4. These NAS and NVR devices support RAID-1 for you to backup your recorded videos.

Reliable - When it comes to data protection, it's safety first. Tape has proved itself a reliable medium, and tape drives themselves have never been more reliable Data loss is a serious threat to companies of all sizes, and catastrophic data loss can destroy a business. But most data loss isn't the result of a big disaster, it's caused by human error, viruses, and disk malfunctions. A suitable backup routine provides the best protection against data loss of all kinds. And tape technology remains the most efficient and cost-effective means to back up your system, whether you're a small business or a global 24x7 operation. tape drives make backup : Fast - Speed is critical because your data is constantly growing while the time available for backup is shrinking. Even the slowest tape drive writes 1 MB per second and the fastest 30 MB per second - that means a 200 GB backup can be completed in less than two hours. Easy - Unlike other storage methods, tape drives offer a range of media that allows you to back up all the data on a small to medium-sized server - up to 200 GB - on a single cartridge. And tape backup captures your system setup information, as well as your data, allowing you to restore your entire system when disaster strikes. What's more, your software can schedule backups to happen automatically at the time most convenient for you. Affordable - Per gigabyte of storage, tape is the most cost-effective way to store large amounts of data. The compact size of tape cartridges also helps keep down your storage costs.
